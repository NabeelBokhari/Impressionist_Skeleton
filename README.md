# Impressionist Painter
A prototype Impressionist Painter for Android

# Setup
To run the app, import the project into Android Studio and run it on either an emulator or a connected Android device

# Using the Painter
First, use the upload icon on the toolbar to load an image from your camera roll. The image will appear on the half of the screen.

Next, either select a brush type from the Brush menu on the lower left of the screen or enable shuffle mode using the button on the 
lower right. The avilable brush types are:
+ Circle
+ Square
+ Circle Splatter
+ Square Splatter

Drag your finger across the right half of the screen to create an impressionist version of the uploaded photo using your selected brush.
When using shuffle mode, a random brush will be selected each time you begin dragging your finger. 

Clear your painting using the clear button on the toolbar. When you are satisfied with your painting, you can save it to your device
using the save icon on the right side of the toolbar
